## My projects
So far so i did some projects to learn varity of programming lang.
here are some of them:
# Python
1. A calculator to calculate Areas of different type of Shapes 
2. Game between You vs Cpu: Rock, Paper & Scissors
3. An updated version of Rock, Paper & Scissors: including New Lizard & Spock as new Choice.
4. A Pokemon-pedia: Not a project, can say a mini task
5. Creating GIF
# Pure Html
Without CSS, JS, nothing. Just to learn from the scratch from FreeCodeCamp:
1) Build a Cat photo app;
2) Build a Recipe Page: Tiramisu;
3) Build a Travel Agency Page: *Small Detail: I did it on the 1st day in the Office in my interny;
4) Build a heart icon: Using `<svg>` tag;
5) Build a video Compilation page: *Small Detail:- I did it in on the 8th day in the Office in my interny alongside learning the Angular Framework
6) Build an HTML Audio and Video Player
# Framework: Angular
1) Portfolio of my self(beta);
2) A student menu(Completed{I guess?});

# School-task 2025/2026
1) Create a page where you describe Java and JS but with a catch. Means by clicking toggle button you can swap the text in between.

That's it for now, I'll update the list in future. Grazie Mille
