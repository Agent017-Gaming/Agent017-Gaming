2. Game between You vs Cpu: Rock, Paper & Scissors
3. An updated version of Rock, Paper & Scissors: including New Lizard & Spock as new Choice.
4. A Pokemon-pedia: Not a project, can say a mini task
5. Just a Fun little code from Chapter 41 lesson: Coundown. *Note* There was a problem doing the code there so i did it here. *Note no.2*There is a second problem. if you run this code it from the vs code it creates a pycache folder
6. My final project of the python Course: Creating GIF
# Pure Html
Without CSS, JS, nothing. Just to learn from the scratch from FreeCodeCamp:
1) Build a Cat photo app;
2) Build a Recipe Page: Tiramisu;
3) Build a Travel Agency Page: *Small Detail: I did it on the 1st day in the Office in my interny;
4) Build a heart icon: Using `<svg>` tag;
5) School-Work: Create a page where you describe Java and JS but with a catch. Means by clicking toggle button you can swap the text in between. 
# Framework: Angular
1) Portfolio of my self(beta);
2) A student menu(beta);

That's it for now, I'll update the list in future. Grazie Mille
